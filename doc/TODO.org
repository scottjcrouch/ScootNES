* NOW
*** fix makefile
*** apu
***** apu irq
***** 0x4010 (dmc) and 0x4017 (frame counter) both issue irq's
******* write cpu to handle multiple irq's
*** more testing and rom tests, esp timing
* LATER
*** oam
***** start oamdma from oamaddr rather than 0
***** oamaddr is set to 0 from ticks 257-320 (of a total 341) of each render scanline
******* reset it to 0 during HBlank???
***** does oamdma write directly to oam or does it write to OAMDATA???
******* https://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/2A03
***** sprite priority
***** spr0 hit
***** spr overflow
*** render scanlines sequentially
***** check applicable accesses to memory
******* vram pointer
******* bank switching???
*** implement rest of ppu register functionality
*** abstract away pattern table access to support bank switching
*** mappers
***** super mario bros mapper (mapper 0)?
***** mapper 1
***** et al.
* REFACTORING/OTHER
*** test on linux
***** SDL_CFLAGS=$(shell sdl-config --cflags)
***** SDL_LIBS=$(shell sdl-config --libs)
*** use switches in read/write methods where sensible
*** use abstract base class with read/write functions
*** c++11
*** exceptions/error checking
*** readme
***** licence
***** pre-requisites
***** provide windows binary
***** test roms (what passes, where to find)
*** icon
* TEST ORDER
*** CPU
*** PPU and video output
*** NMI
*** Joypad
*** CPU Timing and CPU/PPU interaction
*** Sprite 0 hit
*** Sprite overflow
*** $2004 read during rendering trickery
*** APU and audio output
*** Frame IRQs
*** DMC stolen cycles
*** DMC IRQs
*** then start with mappers and/or other input devices.
